## Project
Matrix product states (MPS) are an efficient way to approximate the ground states
of low-dimensional local gapped Hamiltonians [2]. Moreover, techniques based on
such a representation such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)
i.e. a variational method for computing the groundstate for a Hamiltonian in
an MPS representation, have been shown to be the most efficient method for 1-
dimensional systems [1]. In this project, by using these techniques we will examine
the properties of the transverse field Ising model,
$$$$
by means of constructing a MPS for its ground state and using DMRG methods
to determine the critical point and central charge.
